# Image-Viewer-Electron

By choosing a folder full of images, this application can browse through and display them. **(I am still working on this project)**

**Preview:**

I am still trying to solve some problems:
- The app doesn't ignore files that are not image types when you are browsing.
- The images are only displayed correctly under specific window sizes.
