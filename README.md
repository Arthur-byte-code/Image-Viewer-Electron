# Image-Viewer-Electron

By choosing a folder full of images, this application can browse through and display them. **(I am still working on this project)**

I am still trying to solve some problems:
- The app doesn't ignore files that are not image types when you are browsing.
- The images are only displayed correctly under specific window sizes.

Electron.js is an open-source framework that enables the development of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows developers to create native desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, using the same skills and technologies used to build web applications.
